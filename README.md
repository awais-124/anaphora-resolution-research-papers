# RESEARCH PAPERS ON ANAPHORA RESOLUTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

---

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of research papers, articles, and resources focused on anaphora resolution in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Anaphora resolution is the process of identifying antecedents of anaphoric expressions, which is essential in understanding context and meaning in NLP applications such as chatbots, machine translation, information retrieval, and more. This collection is intended for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in deepening their understanding of anaphora resolution methods, challenges, and recent advancements.
